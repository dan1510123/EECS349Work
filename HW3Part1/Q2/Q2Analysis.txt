CRACKME Analysis HW 3 Part 1 Q2

In OllyDB, while debugging step by step using F8 and F9, I noticed that there are two XOR
calls in the assembly, XORing EDI to 5678 and EDI to 1234.
I then turned my input username into integer form (using the ASCII values) and XORed it by 5678 and 1234.
This did not work at first, but when I looked a bit closer at the OllyDb, I noticed a bunch of jumps comparing
the letter and then turning it to uppercase. So when I changed the ascii to only the uppercase values of
all of the letters in my username and then XORed it against 5678 and 1234, I got a working Serial number

For Me:
Username = "Daniel"
Serial = "17889" <= sum of ASCII of "DANIEL" (0x01AD) XOR 0x5678 XOR 0x1234 = 0x45E1 = 17889
