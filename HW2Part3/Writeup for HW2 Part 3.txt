Q1:
Creating some local variables and doing some arithmetic operation and bit manipulation on them.
Then printed the resulting value.
There are some slight changes, but those are likely due to optimizations in using eax over ecx.

Q2:
Creates an array of 8 values. Initializes an index (I called x) and a maxValue int, both to 0.
Loops through the array using a while loop condition on the index < 8 (length of array).
	During loop, if value at x is greater than current maxValue, then set maxValue to the value at x
By the end of the program, maxValue will have the maximum element in the array.
Prints the max value to console.

Q3:
