Step 1:
Program is in directory and is called "PE-Import.exe" as directed. Source code is also included, called "PE-Import.c"

Step 2:
Images for the content in Import Table of PE-Import.exe have a prefix "2" in front of them

Step 3:
3.1: Packed the exe (in the executable that also has the suffix "compressed"
3.2: Images of Import Tables for the packed exe in images prefixed "3.2"
3.3: Images of Import Tables for the unpacked exe in images prefixed "3.3"

Step 4:
As you mentioned in class, you want us to actually create a false positive scenario (unlike what the homework pdf says).
To do this, I just packed the exe and it went from 3 detections to 5 detection in the VirusTotal website
Images to show this are prefixed with "4"

EXTRA:
Additionally, for Part 4, I tried to do Step 4 the way it was written in the homework anyways.
I tried to fool the anti-malware scanner's detection using obfuscation of my code.
The changed code and its executable can be found in the EXTRA folder.
Also, it worked and I fooled two more detections, reducing the original 3 detections down to
1 detection by obfuscating my code with goto's. An image of it can also be found in EXTRA.
